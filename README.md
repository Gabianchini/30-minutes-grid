<h1>Study Project: Exploring CSS Grid with Template Columns, Rows, and Grid Areas</h1>
Welcome to my study project focused on CSS Grid! In this repository, you'll find a hands-on approach to understanding and applying the fundamental concepts of CSS Grid, using template columns, rows, and grid areas properties.

What is CSS Grid?
CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system that allows you to organize HTML elements in rows and columns, creating flexible and responsive layouts. With CSS Grid, you can create complex and harmonious webpage structures by efficiently aligning and distributing content.

About the Project
This project aims to deepen the understanding of CSS Grid through practice. We utilize the template columns and rows properties to define the structure of our grid, enabling precise element positioning. Additionally, we explore the grid area property to name specific areas of the grid, simplifying the positioning process.
